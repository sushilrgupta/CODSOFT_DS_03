# Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

### Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

#### Project Overview:
####  Objective: 
Use the Iris dataset to develop a classification model that can classify iris flower into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

The Iris flower dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics.The dataset contains measurements of various attributes of three different species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each species has 50 samples, making a total of 150 samples in the dataset.
The attributes (features) of the Iris flowers include:
* Sepal length (in cm)
* Sepal width (in cm)
* Petal length (in cm)
* Petal width (in cm)


### Key Insights:
Preprocessed the data to ensure optimal model performance, selected the best model through rigorous evaluation, and visualized the dataset for insightful analysis. üìà Implemented the powerful Decision Tree algorithm along with various classification algorithms and measured üîç accuracy scores and visualized the confusion matrix to validate the model's performance. üéØ Finally, drawn the Decision Tree for intuitive understanding, resulting in a remarkable 99% accuracy!

### This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the significance of feature analysis in machine learning. The fusion of nature's beauty and data-driven insights was truly captivating.
